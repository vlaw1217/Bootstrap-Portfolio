                <p> <strong>I</strong>am originally from Hong Kong. I have lived in Toronto for about 15 years.
                    For my
                    past seven
                    years, I was
                    working at
                    Cathay Pacific Airways as a customer service office. My job was mostly at the counter doing
                    check-in
                    procedure
                    and
                    ticketing issues.


                    I want to change my job because I foresee this kind of job would not be last long in the next
                    ten
                    years.
                    Everything is
                    self could do, self check-in at kiosk, self bag drop and even the ticketing problems. People
                    could
                    do it
                    online
                    by
                    themselves nowadays.


                    Another reason I want to change my job because I love animals more than human. I used to
                    interact
                    different kind
                    of
                    people in my job. I would say I see a lot of "human ugliness". Communicate with animals or would
                    be
                    more
                    comfortable for
                    me. At least, I could act to be myself. Thats why I hope to find another job that it maybe has
                    sustainable
                    development
                    and
                    I am also interested in. Finally, I found it â€” its a web developer.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p><strong>B</strong>ecause of my recent job, I had many chances to visit a lot of countries.
                    Especially
                    last
                    year,
                    after my
                    parent's life
                    were taken by
                    cancers within two years. It struck me heavily and I lost myself. Luckily, I have a lovely
                    cat
                    and
                    my husband is always
                    by
                    my
                    side. He
                    accompanied me to travel Australia, China, and Argentina in last year. I did a lot of fun
                    things
                    that I love
                    have
                    never dream
                    of. I did sky diving in Australia. I walked the great wall in Beijing and it was my first
                    time
                    visiting
                    South
                    America. </p>



                <p><strong>I</strong> love creative and willing to try many new things. Challenging is my
                    favourite.
                    Therefore, I
                    quitted my
                    job
                    and
                    attend the
                    coding boot camp in UofT. I am completely new about it and sometimes feel overwhelming but
                    it is
                    fun
                    and
                    interesting. I
                    put over 10 hours for practicing everyday because I hope it would be filled up my lacking. I
                    know it
                    will take
                    time but
                    I feel confident and I hope I would have opportunities to try it out.
